"""A
dictionary
is like a list, but more general.  In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a
dictionary they can be (almost) any type.
You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called
keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called
a key-value pair or sometimes an item
.
As an example, weâ€™ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the
keys and the values are all strings.
The function
dict
creates a new dictionary with no items.  Because
dict
is the name of a
built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.
>>>            eng2sp = dict()
>>>            print eng2sp
{}
The squiggly-brackets,
{}
, represent an empty dictionary.  To add items to the dictionary,
you can use square brackets:
>>>            eng2sp['one']= 'uno'"""
